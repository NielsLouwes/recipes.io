        "Build the Flavor Base: Heat the 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a large pot. Add 1 large onion, 1 rib celery, 3 medium carrots, 3 cloves garlic (all chopped), and 1 teaspoon dried oregano. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the vegetables soften but don't brown.",
        "Simmer the Soup: Add 1 cup dried lentils (rinsed), 2 medium potatoes (diced), 6 cups vegetable broth, and 1 can crushed tomatoes. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender and the soup is thick. Tip: If using canned lentils, cut the broth and cooking time in half.",
        "Add the Greens: Stir in 7 oz spinach and 1½ tablespoons balsamic vinegar a few minutes before the soup is done. Cook until the greens wilt. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
        "Serve: Serve hot with crusty bread, a drizzle of olive oil or chili oil, and optional toppings like parmesan, scallions, or Greek yogurt."

      "tips": [
        "Build flavor slowly: Sweat onion, carrot, and celery in olive oil until soft, not browned. Add a splash of water if the pan gets dry.",

        "Add greens at the end: Spinach wilts in minutes, keeping your soup bright and fresh.",
        "Balance flavors: A splash of balsamic or lemon juice at the end lifts the earthy lentils.",
        "Rest before serving: Let the soup sit covered for 10 minutes so the flavors meld and the broth thickens."
